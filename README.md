Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to provide different behaviors in different state of objects. For example we can change a parent method for his child.

Inheritance is one of the key feature of Object Oriented Programming, Inheritance can be achieved with three patterns (Pseudoclassical, Functional, Prototypal). You can create a parent class and then inherit all the public methods and properties in child class. 

Encapsulation is  a way of structuring data and methods by concealing the implementation or internal logic of object. For example, a child use a method of a parent, but doesn't know anything about its implementation.
